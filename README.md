-- This Program allows you to visually create polygon hitboxes for gameobjects in Love2D or any other software that 
-- requires a list of x, y vertices.

-- Simply run this using Love2D, click to select the vertices.
-- Press 'p' when done
-- The console will print a list of vertices you can copy/paste into your polygon shape.

-- You can Right Click to remove a point.
-- You can press 'c' to clear all.

-- Remember, Love2D has an unfortunate cap of 8 vertices.
-- I haven't put a cap in here, but you will get an error if you try to use more than 8 points in a polygon shape.
